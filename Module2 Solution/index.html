                <h2>C. V. Raman</h2>
                <p>
                    Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was an Indian physicist who made groundbreaking works in the field of light scattering. With his student K. S. Krishnan, he discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light change wavelength and amplitude. 
                    This phenomenon was a new type of scattering of light and was subsequently known as the Raman effect.
                    His works earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics and was the first Indian or Asian or non-white person to receive Nobel Prize in any branch of science.

                <p>
                    Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai was an Indian physicist and astronomer who initiated space research and helped develop nuclear power in India.
                    He was honoured with Padma Bhushan in 1966 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1972. 
                    He is internationally regarded as the Father of the Indian Space Program.
                    During his lifetime, he practiced Jainism.
                    He attended Gujarat College, Ahmadabad, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940.
                    The famous Sarabhai family were major industrialists committed to the Indian independence movement.
